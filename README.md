* **Description**

Edge-SLAM is an edge-assisted visual simultaneous localization and mapping. Edge-SLAM adapts Visual-SLAM into edge computing architecture to enable long operation of Visual-SLAM on mobile devices. This is achieved by offloading the computation-intensive modules to the edge. Thus, Edge-SLAM reduces resource usage on the mobile device and keeps it constant. Edge-SLAM is implemented on top of [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2).
